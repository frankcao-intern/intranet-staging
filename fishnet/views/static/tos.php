		<h2>Terms of Use</h2>
	</div>

	<p>
		FishNET is owned and operated by EILEEN FISHER and is intended for employee use only. At this time, the
		SeCe Apparel-Canada stores and management team have access to a version of fishNET that allows them to
		view relevant content for their stores, as well as enhance their communication and connection with EILEEN
		FISHER.  Other EILEEN FISHER partners and vendors generally do not have access to fishNET, except to provide
		third-party technology support, but this may change as the site evolves.
	</p>
	<p>
		All information published on fishNET is copyrighted to EILEEN FISHER, INC. Content contributed to fishNET is
		subject to review, editing, and deletion by EILEEN FISHER and to review by its accountants and attorneys.
		EILEEN FISHER also has the right to disclose information contributed to fishNET to persons other than EILEEN
		FISHER employees.
	</p>
	<p>
		Use of fishNET is guided by the policies, procedures, protocols and information outlined in the Electronic
		Communications Policy in both the Wholesale and Retail Employee Handbooks.  In addition, we trust employees
		to be guided by the values in our EILEEN FISHER Mission.  Please take all reasonable care to ensure that any
		content you publish on fishNET is true, accurate and complete. If you believe that an employee has used
		fishNET inappropriately, used information, images or other material from the site inappropriately either on
		fishNET or outside of fishNET, or has posted inappropriate information on fishNET, please contact the Human
		Resources department.
	</p>
	<p>
		In using fishNET, you agree to these terms of use. Depending on the needs of our organization and this site,
		these terms of use may change and will become effective immediately upon publishing.
