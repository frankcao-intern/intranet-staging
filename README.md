# Fishnet - development intranet branch

A repository of *Eileen Fisher's* intranet site for book keeping and version control.

## Frank
Currently working on:
- Adding filters to search engine
- Task manager for retail team (SPEC TBD)

### Progress/Documentation:
#### Week 1
- Acclimating to website!
- Website uses these jQuery frontend plugins:
	- guidely
	- fancy box
	- piwik
	- clickheat
- Backend is codeigniter, and frontend is generated by codeigniter
- Search interacts with mySQL database, most processing is done by SELECT and INSERT statements
	- searchindex is the table that is build for the search engine to access (contains an aggregation of all useful data form mutliple tables)
- getSearchResults() is the main powerhouse function (searches pages), with search() which searches users, i.e. "Who's Who"
	- getSearchResults() is defined in .../model/pages.php and also defined in .../views/page_parts/pages.php (Unsure of purpose of 2nd definition?)
	- There also exists a getSearchResults_count() which counts the number of results you would get from getSearchResults() (seems kind of redundant, might be necessary if it needs to be used seperately)

#### Week 2
- Tags are currently searchable!
	- Tags have a relevance of "1"
	- Tags are grouped by "page_id"
		- The entry with largest "relevance" is taken, rest are dropped
- searchindex (which contains the rebuild search index function) should now rebuild with needed info
	- Rebuilds with tag_id, tag_name, and access now!
- Permissions and "access" should now be considered in search!

#### Week 3 (WIP)
- HTML code and logic for "advanced search" option opening up filters works
- Backend search.php can successfully "POST" filter information from frontend default.php

### Important Changes:
- SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=20047872 (20 MB), to allow for larger search index!
- added new tags to "default.php"

### Possibilities:
- Use SQL REPLACE as well as UNION to string parse before searching
	- Might be too performance heavy... projection of roughly 6x more working
- Multi tag searching? This requires string parsing as well though...
- Use bootstrap for a warped checkbox that is prettier
